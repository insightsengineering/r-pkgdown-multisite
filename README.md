# MultiVersion pkgdown docs action

This Github Actions works under the following assumptions:

* R package documentation is generated by the R function [`pkgdown::build_site`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html)
* Documentation is published to the `gh-pages` branch of the package repository and Github Pages is enabled at the root level of the branch
* The version of `pkgdown` used to generate the documentation is `>= v2.0.0`
* The `pkgdown` documentation uses Bootstrap 5
